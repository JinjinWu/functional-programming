Assignments done in Haskell for school.

## a1 - Write recursive delete function for "trie" data structure
A “trie” is a data structure that implements a dictionary (finite map) that uses strings for keys.
The name “trie” came from “retrieval”.
This assignment implements trie deletion in functional programming by creating a new trie where the key to be deleted no longer points to any value.

## a2 - Compute winning vertices for Edge Geography Game
Two players take turns moving from vertices via edges. Edges can only be used once.
A player wins if their opponent has no unused edge to use.
This assignment computes the vertices that guarantee a win using lazy evaluation and immutable data structures and runs in polynomial space.

## a3 - Practice with custom monads and polymorphism
Create a number guessing game by implementing the polymorphic game master while working with monads.

## a4 - Write a parser and interpreter for a simple functional language
Implement a parser that gives an abstract syntax tree and an interpreter that evaluates the parser's output.
