## a1 - Write recursive delete function for "trie" data structure
A “trie” is a data structure that implements a dictionary (finite map) that uses strings for keys.
The name “trie” came from “retrieval”.
This assignment implements trie deletion in functional programming by creating a new trie where the key to be deleted no longer points to any value.
